## Summary

After enrolling in the Department of Information Science, School of Engineering Science at Osaka University, I gained experience in mobile and backend development at two startup companies. In March 2025, I participated in an internship at pixiv, inc., engaging in backend development using PHP and TypeScript. From August to September 2025, I interned at LY Corporation, where I built a predictive model using Bayesian statistics and worked on backend development. As a community activity, I served as the representative for the Google Developer Group on Campus Osaka University (GDGoC Osaka) from September 2024 to August 2025, organizing tech events and managing development projects. I received the Outstanding GDGoC Organizer MVP award.

### Osaka University, School of Engineering Science, Department of Information Science

Majoring in Information Science and Computer Science.

Studied theoretical fields such as computer architecture, algorithms, networks, and information theory. For independent projects, I developed an Othello AI (C), a shell script interpreter (C), and a custom CPU (VHDL, FPGA).

### Google Developer Group on Campus Osaka University

Served as the Organizer (representative) for GDG on Campus Osaka, a student club at Osaka University.

I organized and managed tech events with 10 to 50 on-site participants. As the event owner, I was responsible for creating flexible schedules, delegating tasks to staff, communicating with stakeholders, and handling on-site troubleshooting. I also designed promotional flyers using Figma.

Additionally, I managed team development projects within the club. For teams of 4-6 people, I managed tasks from the planning and design phases using Design Docs through to Issue-driven development. I learned to break down tasks into appropriate granularities based on member skill levels and assign them in a way that avoids blocking progress.

Furthermore, to transfer technical knowledge to younger members, I led several study sessions, explaining topics like Firebase, CI/CD, and general web frontend/backend development.

### LY Corporation

Participated in a 6-week summer internship.

I joined the budget control team for shopping search ads. As a proposal to improve the ad budget control algorithm, I implemented a Bayesian statistical model to control the budget to maximize the number of conversions (CVs). I understood the existing implementation by reading documents and code, and selected a strategy for maximizing CVs based on the analysis of collected log data.

I decided to use a Bayesian statistical model, which can handle uncertainty, because web advertising is a field with high uncertainty and I had been studying Bayesian statistics in my seminar.

I learned the importance of thoroughly analyzing data before model implementation, starting with a simple model, and learned task management and design methodologies used in a large corporation.

### pixiv, inc.

Participated in a 10-day spring internship.

I was part of the Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure team and implemented the WebAuthn Signal API on the frontend. I investigated the WebAuthn Signal API specifications by referencing W3C documents and domestic/international blogs to determine which APIs to apply and how.

I considered user scenarios for calling the Signal API, discussed with my mentor to ensure an implementation that prioritized UX, and proceeded with implementation after selecting the appropriate APIs.

### Ocarry, inc.

Responsible for developing a luggage delivery application at a startup company.

I handled the entire process from design (using PRDs, Design Docs, etc.) to development with Flutter and Node.js, and release. As I was the only engineer, I carried out development while facing challenges in aligning requirements with the product owner.
